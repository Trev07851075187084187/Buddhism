            <h1>Buddhism</h1>
            <p>Buddhism originated in ancient india over 2,500 years ago. It started with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. 500 million people worship Buddhism which is 6.6% of the world's population. 99% of Buddhists live in the Asia Pacific Region.</p>
            <p>Buddhists have many simple beliefs. They don't have a god but different spirituel people who can guide them, like a non living being named Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhists don't believe in any afterlife except they believe in reincarnation. They have a cycle of reincarnation that is life, death, and reincarnation that is also driven by karma. Buddhists believe that nothing that exists is permanent and everything will ultimately cease to be. There is a belief in rebirth but not of a soul passing from one body to another. The rebirth is more a state of constantly changing being rather than a clear-cut reincarnation.</p>
            <p>The basic beliefs are the four Noble Truths that are: Human life has a lot of suffering, The cause of suffering is greed, There is an end to suffering, and the way to end suffering is to follow the Middle Path. Buddhist have a place called Dharma school that educates Buddhist in the religion. Buddhist praise there Buddhist leader Buddha by giving them fresh flowers, lights and, etc.</p>
            <p>Some buddhist livings and customs are meditating, bowing, making honorings and following ethical guidelines like the 5 precepts. a buddhist celebrations are Vesak which is the most sacred day celebrated on a full moon day usually celebrated on the month of vaisakha (april or may). There are 3 branches in buddhism which are theravada, mahayana, and vajrayana.</p>
            <p>A place of Buddhist worship is called a temple or monastery, Buddhism has local leaders such as priests, monks, nuns, and teachers who are responsible for functioning within specific temples or practice groups, though the concept of a single, overarching leader varies by tradition. Buddhists have a vast body of written works for chanting and devotional practice, though Buddhism, they do not have a single "holy book" comparable to the Bible or Quran. Buddhism gains members through a combination of personal, experiential discovery, missionary work, royal and trade patronage, and cultural adaptability.</p>
            <p>In Buddhism, the "end" of life after death is not an end in itself, but the achievement of Nirvana, which is the cessation of the endless cycle of death and rebirth called samsara. This ultimate goal is reached by eliminating greed, hatred, and ignorance through wisdom and good actions, which liberates one from suffering. At death, a person's consciousness is reborn into a new life determined by their karma, or the consequences of their actions, and the cycle continues until nirvana is attained.</p>
            <p>There are many reasons that Buddhism is unique. Some reasons are, Buddhism doesn’t center around worship of a creator god, but it focuses on personal awakening, and liberation. Second reason is its foundation is the four noble truths, which explain the nature of suffering and the path to end it. The third reason is instead of faith in divine intervention, Buddhism emphasizes self-effort through mindfulness, meditation and ethical living. Fourth reason is enlightenment in Buddhism is seen as a state of inner realization, not as a reward granted by a deity. Lastly the teachings are more like a practical path or philosophy of life rather than rigid dogma or commandments.</p>
