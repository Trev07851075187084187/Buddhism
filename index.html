            <h1>Buddhism</h1>
            <p>Buddhism originated in ancient India over 2,500 years ago. It started with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. Worldwide there are 500 million Buddhists which makes up 6.6% of the world's population. 481,290,000 Buddhists live in the Asia Pacific region, which is 96.2% of all followers.</p>
            <p>Buddhists are very simple with simple lives and beliefs .They don't have a one certain God but people who guide them.They mostly have a spiritual being named “Budda”. Buddhists don't believe in an afterlife where they go to heaven or but mostly in reincarnation .They have a cycle of reincarnation that is life, death, then reincarnation.Your life after reincarnation is dependent on the karma from your past life. Buddhists have a belief where nothing is permanent and everything will cease to be. Buddhists also believe in Reaper but not in one Soul passing to another but mostly having the same consciousness as your old life.There are four Noble Truths. They are: human life has a lot of suffering, the cause of suffering is greed, there is an end to suffering, and the way to end suffering is to follow the middle path. Buddhas have a certain type of school called ”Dhama” that teaches about the Buddhist belief. Buddhists praise their leader Buddha by giving them items such as fresh flowers, lights, and more.</p>
            <p>Buddhism is unique in many different ways. Buddhas are very unique in their belief around not worshiping a God but It focuses around personal awakening and libertarian. Another reason is its belief in the Four Noble Truths that explains the nature of suffering and how to end the suffering.There's also the belief where they don't believe in divine intervention, but they believe in self effort meditating. Buddha's also believe Buddhism is seen as Inner self awareness that isn't granted by a reward. Lastly the teaching is more like a philosophy and not like the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>Buddhist people value things like kindness, respect, and disciplining yourself. They believe in things like Nirvana, the four noble truths, or follow things in different sectors of Buddhism like Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Theravada means “ Doctrine of the Elders” and is like a school of buddhism and takes a lot of what they teach from the Tipitaka, which are their main scriptures and is taught to keep the old teachings of Buddhism alive. Mahayana means “the great vehicle” and is the largest branch of buddhism and teaches samsara which represents the cycle of rebirth and teaches you to achieve enlightenment. Vajrayana means “the diamond vehicle” is more like another version of Mahayana and uses spiritual techniques to reach enlightenment. The 5 precepts are guides to help you learn buddhist livings and ethics. The 5 precepts are 1. No killing, 2. No stealing, 3. No misusing sex, 4. No engaging fake speech, and 5. No having drugs, alcohol or anything similar. No killing represents respecting life and stopping yourself to harm others. No stealing represents being honest and respecting other peoples things. No misusing sex represents responsible sexual actions. No engaging fake speech represents stopping yourself from saying things that could hurt someone's reputation. No having drugs or alcohol represents self control and refusing addictions. The 4 noble truths are suffering, the things that cause suffering, ending suffering, and the eightfold path. The first one tells you that there is always going to be suffering in life and you can’t stop it. The second one is saying that by bringing yourself away from others causes you suffering. The third one tries to say that suffering will end once we reach enlightenment and reach Nirvana. The eightfold path is our spiritual practices that will help us reach Nirvana.</p>   
            <p>The places where Buddhists worship could be called a temple or a monastery. You also don't need to go to a temple to worship with others, they could worship at home as well. They will set an area out of the way and create a shrine with a statue of the Buddha, candles and a burner. Buddhist temples come in many different shapes. They are created to symbolize the 5 different elements which are fire, air, earth, water and wisdom.
                Buddhism has local leaders such as monks, nuns, priests and teachers. They are responsible for functioning within specific practice groups or temples, though the idea of a single primary leader can change by tradition. Buddhists have a huge body of written works for when chanting and during devotional practice. Buddhists don't have one specific holy book of any kind that is comparable to the Bible or the Quran. When someone wants to join Buddhism, they have to show a combination of personal, experiential discovery, missionary work, royal and trade patronage, and cultural flexibility.</p>
